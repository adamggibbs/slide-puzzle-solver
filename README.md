## Description:
This document contains the write up of our slide puzzle solver project. This README contains the following sections: our task, our implementations for solving that task, a description of our use of multithreading to improve performance, a comaprison of our different implementations, a description of each piece of our code in the repository, and how to compile and run our programs.
## Our Task:
This Project aims to create a slide puzzle game and a brute force solver for the optimal
solution to any <b>n x m</b> slide puzzle. We will utilize parallel programming to speed up
the brute force solver to be able to solve larger puzzles and puzzles with larger shuffles
within a reasonable amount of time. Possible extensions to this project would be 
implementing a approximate solver that finds near-optimal solutions and seeing
how that compares to brute force and how/if that solver benefits from parallization. Also,
adding visualizations such as watching the slide puzzle get solved optimally after the 
Solver finds the optimal solution or a program that converts am image into a <b>n x m</b> puzzle
and unscrambles it after finding the solution. 
## Our implementations:

We had several implementations of slide puzzle sovlers that each perform the task of finding the optimal solution for any given shuffled slide puzzle of size <b>n x m</b>. Some implementations are run sequentially while others are designed to be run in parallel. Below are descriptions of each implementation and the following sections explain and compare the use of multithreading in more depth. 

### Sequential Solver (Adam will do this)

### Parallel State Solver (Adam will do this)

### Parallel Tree (Adam will do this)

### Sequential Solver with Pruning
  - This solver is very similar to the sequential solver, however the 'PuzzlePruning' class holdss a pointer to the parent puzzle that produced a given state rather than an ArrayList of previous moves. In addition, this solver uses an ArrayList of all generated puzzle states rather than a queue and only adds puzzle states to the ArrayList if the ArrayList doesn't already contain a 'PuzzlePruning' object that has an identical <b>n x m</b> puzzle state.

### Parallel with One Combiner
  - This solver uses a thread pool with one thread combining the puzzle states generated by the remaining threads. The data structure that is shared with the producer threads is a Concurrent HashMap, and the combiner reads from this Hashmap and adds puzzle states to another Concurrent HashMap if they aren't already contained in the HashMap. One problem with this solution is the combiner thread will eventually fall behind the producer threads, and the main thread that gives the producer puzzle states to generate from will have to wait. This waiting essentially slows the solver down to the speed of one producer and one combiner.

### Parallel with Two Combiners
  - This solver uses the same producer threads as the parallel solution with one combiner, but attempts to solve the waiting problem described by having two combiners. However, having two combiners creates different problems including the need for more shared objects and the need to continually check if the thread pool has been shutdown.

## Componenets of the Repository (Add other files I don't have listed with explainations)
A list of all java classes in the repository and a description of their contents and functionality. A brief explaination of how to use these classes is also included.
(To Ben and Scott: Write a description of your files and programs here. I say we do somewhat of a bulleted format but that's not 100% necessary)
#### Puzzle.java
  - Holds the 2D array with position of puzzle pieces
  - Methods for moving pieces on the board. All moves are realtive to the open spot
    so "move up" means the open space moves up even tho this visually appears as the 
    physical piece above the open space moving down into the open space.
  - Method to shuffle the board to begin solving the puzzle
  - Methods to print the board and the previous moves that have been done to the board
  
#### Solver.java
  - Contains methods involved with solving the puzzle
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method in parallel with small parallel tasks
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method by dividing the BFS tree into multiple smaller trees to be run in parallel
  - Has method that prints the moves to the optimal solution of the puzzle after being solved
  - All methods are static so they can be called without an instance of the Solver class via Solver.<i>solve-method()</i>

#### ProcessStateTask.java
  - Runnable task for parallel solver
  - Used in Solver.parallelSolve() as its parallel task
  - Gets a puzzle and checks if it's solved, then adds its children to the queue of states to be checked

#### ParallelSequentialTask.java
  - Runnable task for parallel tree solver
  - Used in Solver.parallelTreeSolve as its parallel task
  - Takes in a puzzle and runs sequential solve with the given puzzle as the initial puzzle
  - Either sets found solution as the global solved puzzle or thread is interrupted and it does nothing

#### Main.java (Ben will do this)
  - Contains only a main method to test out the functionality of 
    Puzzle and Solver
    
#### PuzzlePruning.java
  - Holds the 2D array with position of puzzle pieces
  - Holds a pointer to the parent state to this puzzle state and the move it took to produce this state from the parent state
  - Methods for moving pieces on the board identical to the Puzzle.java class for the sequential solution without pruning.
  - Method to shuffle the board to begin solving the puzzle
  - Methods to print the board and the previous moves that have been done to the board
  
#### SolverPruning.java
  - Contains methods involved with solving the puzzle
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method with pruning
  - Has method that solves the puzzle using a thread pool with one combiner and multiple producers
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a thread pool with two combiners and multiple producers
  - Has method that prints the moves to the optimal solution of the puzzle after being solved
  - All methods are once again static so they can be called without an instance of the Solver class via Solver.<i>solve-method()</i>

#### NextStateTaskPruning.java
  - Producer task for the parallel solver
  - Used in SolverPruning.parallelSolve() and SolverPruning.parallelSolve() as its parallel task
  - Gets a puzzle and produces the next states. If a child state is solved it updates a shared boolean to tell the main thread a solution has been found. Regardless of whether a state is a solution or not this task adds all its children to the Concurrent HashMap that will be checked by the sombiner task

#### CombinerTask.java
  - Runnable task for parallel tree solver
  - Used in Solver.parallelTreeSolve as its parallel task
  - Takes in a puzzle and runs sequential solve with the given puzzle as the initial puzzle
  - Either sets found solution as the global solved puzzle or thread is interrupted and it does nothing

#### CombinerTaskParallelV2.java
  - Runnable task for parallel tree solver
  - Used in Solver.parallelTreeSolve as its parallel task
  - Takes in a puzzle and runs sequential solve with the given puzzle as the initial puzzle
  - Either sets found solution as the global solved puzzle or thread is interrupted and it does nothing

#### MainPruning.java
  - Contains only a main method to test out the functionality of 
    Puzzle and Solver
    
#### Output Files for Pruning
  - Tests run for pruning files
    
    
## How to compile and run on the command line: (Ben will do this)
#### To Compile: 
  - <i>$</i> javac Main.java
#### To run: 
  - To use default puzzle dimensions (4x4): 

    <i>$</i> java Main

  - To use user defined puzzle dimensions: 

    <i>$</i> java Main <i>n m</i> 
    
    where <b>m, n</b> are integers specifying puzzle dimensions
