This output file compares the non pruning sequential version to the pruning versions of sequential and parallel with one combiner
    solving 3x3 puzzles and one 4x4 puzzle.

NOTES: we can see for all the solves the sequential with out pruning is substantially faster
       however, occasionally the sequential version with out pruning will very quickly run out of space
       after memory is full, it will throw a heap space error because it doesn't use pruning
       those examples are not shown because the pruning versions did not complete within 2 hours
       comparing the two that use pruning, again we can definitely see the improvement for solutions that take longer to find
