## Description:
This document contains the write up of our slide puzzle solver project. This README contains the following sections: our task, our implementations for solving that task, a description of our use of multithreading to improve performance, a comaprison of our different implementations, a description of each piece of our code in the repository, and how to compile and run our programs.
## Our Task:
This Project aims to create a slide puzzle game and a brute force solver for the optimal
solution to any <b>n x m</b> slide puzzle. We will utilize parallel programming to speed up
the brute force solver to be able to solve larger puzzles and puzzles with larger shuffles
within a reasonable amount of time. Possible extensions to this project would be 
implementing a approximate solver that finds near-optimal solutions and seeing
how that compares to brute force and how/if that solver benefits from parallization. Also,
adding visualizations such as watching the slide puzzle get solved optimally after the 
Solver finds the optimal solution or a program that converts am image into a <b>n x m</b> puzzle
and unscrambles it after finding the solution. 
## Our implementations:

We had several implementations of slide puzzle sovlers that each perform the task of finding the optimal solution for any given shuffled slide puzzle of size <b>n x m</b>. Some implementations are run sequentially while others are designed to be run in parallel. Below are descriptions of each implementation and the following sections explain and compare the use of multithreading in more depth. 

### Sequential Solver
This solver uses breadth first search to find the optimal solution. The initial shuffled puzzle is added to a queue and then while the queue is not empty, we pop a puzzle off the queue and process it. Processing a puzzle state involves checking if it is solved, in which case it is returned as the solution, but if it is not solved it finds all possible next states and adds them all to the queue. Possible next states are the states that can be obtained from the current state by making one valid move (non valid moves would be moving the piece off the board in the case it was on the edge). We also don't go back to the parent state, so if the previous move on that state was down we wouldn't then move back up because we know that wouldn't be a solution. This process continues until a solution is found and returned. It returns a solved puzzle which contains an arraylist of the moves needed to solve that puzzle. 

### Parallel State Solver
This solver uses the same approach as the sequential solver except the processing of each state is considered a task. So every time a state is popped off the queue, it is made into a task and sent to a thread pool to be completed. To make this happen, we used a concurrent queue so that multiple threads can add their children to the queue without contention causing errors. We also have an AtomicReference variable that is set to be null until a thread finds a solution and updates the AtomicReference to contain the solution found. At that point the while loop popping tasks off the queue stops since a solution has been found and it returns that solution. This solution almost always returns the optimal solution and we actually haven't had a test return a suboptimal solution yet. The onlly chance a suboptimal solution could occur is if a task with a solution crashes before updates the AtomicReference or if there are two solution each one move apart and the suboptimal task beats the optimal task to updating AtomicReference.
### Parallel Tree
This solver uses a similar approach to the sequential solver but splits the task into multiple sequential tasks. This solution we devised after noticing that the sequential solver actually beats the parallel state solver for most tests and this is because the task of checking a puzzle state is so quick that the overhead from creating a pool task counters the speed up from checking <i>nThreads</i> puzzle states in parallel. This solution works by getting the first <b><i>s</i></b> number of states where s is in (<i>nThreads-3</i>, <i>nThreads</i>). We choose this number of states because the way the BFS tree is structured, each parent has 2 or 3 states and if we reach nThreads-2 states, then we cannot pop off a state and add all its children. Otherwise we'd have more intial states than threads and that would be slow. Then we take all those puzzle states and run sequential solve with each puzzle state as the initial puzzle. These calls to sequential solve are done in parallel and when one finds a solution it updates an AtomicReference to store the solved puzzle. At this point, the solver shuts down the pool and all other calls to sequential solve get terminated. This solution can also return a suboptimal solution if one thread reaches a solution at a greater depth faster than another thread finds the optimal solution. This solution can also return suboptimal solutions if a thread crashes and the optimal solution was in its part of the tree. However, there is also overlap on the trees since we don't prune to eliminate already checked states. So an optimal solution may appear in multiple threads' searches. We can guarantee that the solution returned is at worst the <i>nThread-th</i> best solution, so in the case of 4 threads, the returned solution is definitely at worst the 4th best.

### Parallel with One Combiner
  - This solver uses a thread pool with one thread combining the puzzle states generated by the remaining threads. The data structure that is shared with the producer threads is a Concurrent HashMap, and the combiner reads from this Hashmap and adds puzzle states to another Concurrent HashMap if they aren't already contained in the HashMap. One problem with this solution is the combiner thread will eventually fall behind the producer threads, and the main thread that gives the producer puzzle states to generate from will have to wait. This waiting essentially slows the solver down to the speed of one producer and one combiner.

### Parallel with Two Combiners
  - This solver uses the same producer threads as the parallel solution with one combiner, but attempts to solve the waiting problem described by having two combiners. However, having two combiners creates different problems including the need for more shared objects and the need to continually check if the thread pool has been shutdown.

## Componenets of the Repository (Add other files I don't have listed with explainations)
A list of all java classes in the repository and a description of their contents and functionality. A brief explaination of how to use these classes is also included.
(To Ben and Scott: Write a description of your files and programs here. I say we do somewhat of a bulleted format but that's not 100% necessary)
#### Puzzle.java
  - Holds the 2D array with position of puzzle pieces
  - Methods for moving pieces on the board. All moves are realtive to the open spot
    so "move up" means the open space moves up even tho this visually appears as the 
    physical piece above the open space moving down into the open space.
  - Method to shuffle the board to begin solving the puzzle
  - Methods to print the board and the previous moves that have been done to the board
  
#### Solver.java
  - Contains methods involved with solving the puzzle
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method in parallel with small parallel tasks
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method by dividing the BFS tree into multiple smaller trees to be run in parallel
  - Has method that prints the moves to the optimal solution of the puzzle after being solved
  - All methods are static so they can be called without an instance of the Solver class via Solver.<i>solve-method()</i>

#### ProcessStateTask.java
  - Runnable task for parallel solver
  - Used in Solver.parallelSolve() as its parallel task
  - Gets a puzzle and checks if it's solved, then adds its children to the queue of states to be checked

#### ParallelSequentialTask.java
  - Runnable task for parallel tree solver
  - Used in Solver.parallelTreeSolve as its parallel task
  - Takes in a puzzle and runs sequential solve with the given puzzle as the initial puzzle
  - Either sets found solution as the global solved puzzle or thread is interrupted and it does nothing

#### Main.java (Ben will do this)
  - Contains only a main method to test out the functionality of 
    Puzzle and Solver
    
#### PuzzlePruning.java
  - Holds the 2D array with position of puzzle pieces
  - Holds a pointer to the parent state to this puzzle state and the move it took to produce this state from the parent state
  - Methods for moving pieces on the board identical to the Puzzle.java class for the sequential solution without pruning.
  - Method to shuffle the board to begin solving the puzzle
  - Methods to print the board and the previous moves that have been done to the board
  
#### SolverPruning.java
  - Contains methods involved with solving the puzzle
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a brute force method with pruning
  - Has method that solves the puzzle using a thread pool with one combiner and multiple producers
  - Has method that solves the puzzle with a thread pool with two combiners and multiple producers
  - Has method that prints the moves to the optimal solution of the puzzle after being solved

#### NextStateTaskPruning.java
  - Producer task for the parallel solver with pruning
  - Used in SolverPruning.parallelSolve() and SolverPruning.parallelSolve_V2() as its parallel task
  - Gets a puzzle and produces the next states. If a child state is solved it updates a shared boolean to tell the main thread a solution has been found. Regardless of whether a state is a solution or not this task adds all its children to the Concurrent HashMap that will be checked by the combiner task(s).

#### CombinerTask.java
  - This task goes through each threadID in order in the concurrent HashMap `map`, checks to see if any of the puzzle states produced are solved.
  - If a state is solved it updates the AtomicRefernce to reference the solved puzzle and end the program.
  - If a state isn't solved and isn't in the concurrent Hashmap `bigList` it adds the state.

#### CombinerTaskParallelV2.java
  - This task is very similar to the `CombinerTask`, however it as the added AtomicInteger `oddOReven` so one combiner task will check even threads and one will check odd.
  - The even combiner will send even puzzle states and the odd combiner odd puzzle states vie the concurrent Hashmap `biglist` again.

#### MainPruning.java
  - Contains the main method to test the same puzzle solve for each type of solution: sequential with pruning, parallel with one combiner, and parallel with two combiners.
    
#### Output Files for Pruning
  - Tests run for pruning files comparing all methods including some comarisons to the brute force sequential solver with out pruning.
