This output file compares the pruning versions of sequential, parallel with one combiner, and parallel with two combiners
    solving 4x4 puzzles.

NOTES: the parallel with two combiners is more an attempt of an idea and does not always perform better than the parallel with one combiner.
       this could be for many reasons including the need for the combiners to check if the pool has been shut down
       and the increased number of thread shared objects.
