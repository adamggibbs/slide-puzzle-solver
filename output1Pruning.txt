This output file compares the pruning versions of sequential and of parallel with one combiner
    solving 3x3 puzzles.

NOTES: for simple solutions the sequential is faster, above 14 moves to solve, parallel is faster.
       this makes sense because the time to make threads doesn't make up for the speed up of having threads
       because the solution is quick to find.
